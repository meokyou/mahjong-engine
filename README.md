## Traditional Mahjong Engine

麻雀 ("mahjong" in Japanese), here, in America, alongside American mahjong, is seemingly more popular than 麻将 ("mahjong" in Chinese). I like both variations, but it is saddening that both haven't caught on over here. I will be working on a mahjong engine to model the game.
